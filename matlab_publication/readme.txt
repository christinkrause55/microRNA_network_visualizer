These scripts were used to perform the statistical analysis for the microarray in https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.92075.2
Expression and phenotypic databases are available upon request. 

1. callDatabase.m is used to load expression and phenotypic data into the workspace and to perform logistic and linear regression analysis. The results can be found in the provided SQLite database.

The figures generated by the following scripts are not part of the manuscript and serve further visualisation for target microRNA identification:
2. heatmap.m is then used to order and visualize target microRNAs.
3. clustering.m is called to perform clustering of individuals based on microRNAs.
4. drawGraph.m is finally called to visualize the correlation of microRNA and (potential) target gene expression (getGraphWeights.m). Moreover, it calls a seed prediction function (getSeedPrecition.m), 
which is the core of microRNA NVis.

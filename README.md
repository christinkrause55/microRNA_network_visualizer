## microRNA network visualizer (miRNA NVis)
This tool framework implemented in MATLAB (R2020a, TheMathWorks) can be used for high throughput analysis of microRNA microarray data sets.
A database connection and database which manages the underlying data will be published upon publication to ensure reproducible data usage. 

Currently only mouse based data processing is uploaded to this repo. A similar framework for human data will be uploaded after publication of the respective manuscript. 

The getSeedPrediction.m script can be used as a standalone function.
